# Maintenance Notes

## Checking the Power

### Identifying all the things:

1. **BATTERY** - The heart of it all!
2. **Charge Controller 1 (CC1)** - The black box to the right of the battery
	* Indicator LEDs
		* Should be green, green, and slow blinking green (L to R)
	* Power Connections ( L to R)
	* Battery and CC2* Solar Panels AKA Photovoltaic Cells (PV)
3. **Charge Controller 2 (CC2)** - The black box on the ledge
	* LCD Screen - located on CC2
		* Displays Charging Current, Battery Voltage, OFF / Output Current
	* Power Button or Power Switch - Red button that toggles power to the sculpture ON/OFF
		* When ON the LCD displays Output Current to the right of the Batter Voltage
		* When OFF the LCD displays OFF to the right of the Batter Voltage
	* Power connections ( L to R )
		* The backup emergency charging power supply is connected to the photovoltaic screw terminals on the far left
		* The BATTERY is connected to the middle pair of screw terminals
		* Right pair of screw terminals is not connected to anything
		* The sculpture is plugged into one of the 12 Volt output jacks with a plug that has red and black wires.
4. BACKUP CHARGER - backup emergency charging power supply that looks like a Windows Laptop charger. It's connected to the PV inputs on CC2. The power connection is on the far left of the ledge. An extension should be able to reach it no problem.

**DO NOT PLUG IN THIS CHARGER WITHOUT READING BELOW**

### The Procedure:

#### Start of the Day

1. When you arrive at AI, the sculpture should be **OFF** and in the **CLOSED** position.
2. Check the **LCD** on **CC2**
	* The Voltage should read between 12V and 14V
		* If just at or below 12.5V, plug in the **BACKUP CHARGER** and charge for about an hour or until AI doors open.
			* Unplug the **BACKUP CHARGER**.
		* If above 12.5V, **DO NOTHING**
3. Make sure the **BACKUP CHARGER** is **UNPLUGGED**
4. Turn the sculpture ON by pressing the red Power Button on **CC2** once.
	* Pump should come on immediately
	* Sculpture should open and close normally

#### End of the day

1. Wait until the sculpture is in the **CLOSED** position
2. Turn OFF by pressing the red Power Button on **CC2** once.
3. Check the **LCD** on **CC2**
4. The Voltage should read between 12V and 14V
	* If just at or below 12.5V, plug in the **BACKUP CHARGER** and charge for about an hour.
		* Unplug the **BACKUP CHARGER**.
		* If above 12.5V, **DO NOTHING**.
5. Make sure the **BACKUP CHARGER** is **UNPLUGGED** before closing up!
